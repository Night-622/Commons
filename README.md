A persistent, shared-map city builder. Every player owns a 24×24 plot on one master map, next to real neighbours. Cities keep running while you're away (up to 3 days), and cities that collapse stay on the map as ruins with a record.

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript modules on Firebase Hosting, with Firestore and Firebase Auth. No build step.

## Sign-in options

Enable these in the Firebase console under **Authentication → Sign-in method**:

- **Email/Password**
- **Anonymous** (this is "Play as a guest")
- **Google**

Guests can turn their guest city into a full account later (Account menu). Linking keeps the same user id, so the city comes along.

## Deploy

Push to `main`. The GitHub Action deploys hosting. Deploy Firestore rules with `npm run deploy:rules`.

## Local test

```
npm test          # simulation tests
npm run serve     # local server
```

## Files
